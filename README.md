# About

Egosoft almost fully implemented Paranid Mass Driver and Teladi Muon Charger but failed to polish and release them. This leaves only the Argon with a race specific weapon the Argon Ion Blaster. This mod:

* Adds the Paranid Mass Driver and Teladi Muon Charger to the game.

* Adds their blueprints for sale.

* NPCs should use the Mass Driver, but non Muon Charger. If this is not the case please report an issue.

* Fixes an issue with the Mass Driver Medium MK1 always overheating and never being able to fire off a round.

* Fixes an issue with both Mass Driver MK1s having no consequence for overheating.

* Fixes an issue with a declare not being placed properly for the Mass Driver Medium MK2

* Balances the Muon Charger in such a way that their low attention combat damage isn't anymore broken than the Ion Blaster.

* Changed the Muon Charger charge time from 1 second to 5.

* Fixes an issue where the Small MK2 Muon Charger was using the MK1's bullets.

# What do these weapons do?

* The mass driver is a sniper rifle with limit hits before it overheats.

* The Muon Charger is a charging weapon. It is very similiar to Plasma Cannon, but has a charge time where you have to hold the fire button down.

# What Is Modified?

* Patched All the Muon Charger Bullet Macros, and the Mass Driver Mk1's Bullet Macros.

* Patched the weapon macros for the Mass Driver Mk1's Bullet Macros, and the weapon macro for the Muon Charger Mk2.

* Patched the loadout file for the Mass Driver Medium MK2

* Patched the warefile to make all these weapons available and have blueprints.
